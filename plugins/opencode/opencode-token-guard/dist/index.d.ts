 * Guards long agent sessions against token burn. Every provider step re-reads
 * the full (cached) conversation, so the plugin attacks step count and context
 * size directly:
 *
 * - blocks streaks of single-purpose bash calls (chain/batch instead),
 * - nudges when verification runs happen after too few edits,
 * - nudges at a step budget and a context-size budget per session.
 *
 * Thresholds are configurable via TOKEN_GUARD_* environment variables.
